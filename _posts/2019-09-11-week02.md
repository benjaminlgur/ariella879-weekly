### Blog #2

#### Question 1: What types of contributions do you think are suitable choices for you to make as your first contributions to an open source project?

The contributions that I think are suitable choices for me to make as my first contributions are:

* Make spelling and grammer corrections in the documentation
* Check for bugs in the project and submit them
* Make suggestions on how to improve the project 
* Improve the documentation if applicable 
* Contact the creators and ask how I can help

#### Question 2: What types of projects interest you and how do you see your relationship to them?

The types of projects that interest me are contributions to projects that were made by one or two people or a group of developers because then I can help them complete what they are working on and gain experience in coding. I also would love to contribute my knowledge to Wikipedia and Open Street Map because then I would be helping people by providing missing or updating information.
