### Blog #2

#### Question 1: What types of contributions do you think are suitable choices for you to make as your first contributions to an open source project?

The contributions that I think are suitable choices for me to make as my first contributions are:

* Make spelling and grammer corrections in the documentation
* Check for bugs in the project and submit them
* Make suggestions on how to improve the project 
* Improve the documentation if applicable 
* Contact the creators and ask how I can help

#### Question 2: What types of projects interest you and how do you see your relationship to them?

I have no particular projects that I am interested in. I am hoping to look at different types of projects, see how I can contribute to them, and figure out what I am interested in.
