#### What I did not know about open source software 

I decided to take a class in open source software in order to familarize myself with many different types of projects. However, I am defintely not someone who is familiar at all with it. So, when I read about it in the article: *10 things you should know about open source before you use it*, I learned more about open source. I was shocked to find out that is not always free because my understanding of open source software is that everyone can contribute to it, so then it should be free. I do understand that companies need to make money so they make a paid version of it. Another thing that I didnt have previous knowledge of but later myself found out in the course is that it is not just for programmers, in fact people who do not know even one programming language use it. I had previously thought that open source was exclusively a place for programmers to edit and improve each other's code. I was wrong. What surprised me more than anything was that right now I am currently using open source software: Firefox and had used open source software many times before without even knowing it.
